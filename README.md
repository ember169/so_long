# so_long - A small 2D game
This project is a small 2D game. Its purpose is to work with textures, sprites, and other basic gameplay elements.<br>

## Description
2D top-down game developed as part of the 42 Common Core curriculum. The goal is to create a basic engine using the MiniLibX library, focusing on window management, event handling (keyboard and mouse), and sprite rendering. <br>

### The game
The player must collect all items on the map and reach the exit in the shortest number of moves possible.
- **Graphics:** 2D tileset-based rendering.
- **Controls:** WASD or Arrow keys to move.
- **Mechanics:** Move counting in the terminal, wall collisions, and collectible management.

### Technical constraints
- **Library:** Developed using MiniLibX (simple graphics library for X Window System).
- **Memory Management:** Zero memory leaks allowed (checked with valgrind).
- **Error Handling:** The program must parse .ber map files and handle invalid configurations (missing exit/player/collectible, non-rectangular maps, or unreachable goals) by displaying a clean Error message.
- **Algorithm:** Includes a pathfinding check to ensure the map is actually playable before launching.
